# Data-Science-Portfolio.
 This repository illustrates some of my data science projects.

## Accessing the whole repository.
  Accessing the whole repository can be done by cloning the repository on your local machine.
  
  ### Clone the repository by performing the following steps on you local machine:
  > - Open the git terminal on your preferred directory.
  > -  Write *git clone repo URL* on the terminal to access all the content of the repository.


## Acessing individual folders of the repository.
  Most of the contents in this repository are jupyter notebook files. 
    The easiest way to view the notebooks is through [jupyter nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org).
  
  Likewise, if you have Jupyter notebook installed on your pc and would like to keep them locally, do the following :
   **Download [Subversion for windows](https://sourceforge.net/projects/win32svn/)** or checkout this [site](https://wandisco.com/svn) 
     to download your preferred subversion client/servers based on your OS.
  
   **Navigate to the folder you want to download**. e.g the *Exploring 67 years of Lego* folder has path  
   `https://github.com/Besong/Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/master/Exploring%2067%20years%20of%20Lego`
  
   **Modify the URL for subversion**. Replace `tree/master` with `trunk`.
  
  `https://github.com/Besong/Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/master/Exploring%2067%20years%20of%20Lego`  **to**
  `https://github.com/Besong/Data-Science-Portfolio/trunk/Exploring%2067%20years%20of%20Lego`

  **Download the folder**.  Go to the command line and grab the folder with SVN

  `svn checkout https://github.com/Besong/Data-Science-Portfolio/trunk/Exploring%2067%20years%20of%20Lego`
